# Collatz Conjecture 

A Python program that explores the **Collatz Conjecture** and visualizes the number of steps each integer takes to reach 1 using a recursive algorithm.

## How to run
Have Python and matplotlib installed
```bash
pip install matplotlib
```

Then run:
```bash
python "Collatzin konjektuuri.py"
```

## What Is the Collatz Conjecture?
The Collatz Conjecture (also known as the 3n + 1 problem) follows these rules:

- Start with any positive integer n

- If n is even → divide it by 2

- If n is odd → multiply it by 3 and add 1

- Repeat until the number reaches 1

The conjecture states that every positive integer will eventually reach 1.
